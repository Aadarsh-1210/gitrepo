    <p>hello </p><!--step 1->this index.html file is initially untracked by the html as it does not exits on github it ison the local system
    So I need to use git add followed by the git commit commands to make this file trackable by git so that it may know that a local change 
    has been done on the system and it can get ammended on the github repository commit history as well 
    Step 2-commands to be used 
    git add <file name> // just to add a single modified or untracked file 
    git add . // to add all the files all at oce if the number of files are more to get added and commited  
    git commit -m "Message about the commit" -->
</body>
